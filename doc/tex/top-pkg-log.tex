The standard library {\tt log} package is a low-level redirection kludge allowing logging from almost anywhere in the package hierarchy, even though much of the logging logic might be higher in the hierarchy than the logging package (meaning that attempting direct access would result in a fatal cyclic-package-dependencies error).

The {\tt log} package source code is in \ahrefloc{src/lib/std/src/log.pkg}{src/lib/std/src/log.pkg}.
