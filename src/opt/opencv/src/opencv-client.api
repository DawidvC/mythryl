# opencv-client.api
#
# Here we define the primary low-level end-user
# api for constructing Opencv GUI interfaces.
#
# This api is implemented by the generic package
#
#     src/opt/opencv/src/opencv-client-g.pkg
#
# which is instantiated twice:
#
#     src/opt/opencv/src/opencv-client-for-library-in-main-process.pkg
#     src/opt/opencv/src/opencv-client-for-library-in-c-subprocess.pkg
#
# The former puts the Opencv library code in our main
# Mythryl process address space; the latter puts it
# in a subprocess, controlled via a pipe.
#
# Putting the Opencv code in the main process is potentially
# faster but carries the risk that loose pointers in the
# Opencv C code can corrupt the delicate and dynamic Mythryl
# heap.  Pointer bugs have always been endemic in C code,
# so this is a nontrivial risk.
#
# Putting the Opencv code in a subprocess yields the opposite
# cost/benefit tradeoff:  Passing control back and forth
# through the control pipe may potentially slow down the
# GUI, but bugs in the Opencv C code cannot possible crash
# the main Mythryl application; at most they can crash
# the Opencv subprocess.  (Note that on a multicore machine
# putting the Opencv display code in a subprocess may actually
# improve performance, by allowing the Opencv code to run in
# parallel with the main Mythyrl process.)

# Compiled by:
#     src/lib/std/standard.lib

# Implemented in:
#     src/opt/opencv/src/opencv-client-for-library-in-main-process.pkg
#     src/opt/opencv/src/opencv-client-for-library-in-c-subprocess.pkg
