This is the Lib7 Library.  It is free software distributed under the Lib7
system's license (see the LICENSE file for details).

This directory holds the standard Lib7 libraries, one per subdirectory:

  Directory		Sources File		Description
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  utilities		lib7.lib		This is the general utility library.

  controls		controls.lib	This is a library of support code
						for managing application controls.

  hash-consing		hash-cons.lib	This is a library supporting hash-consing
						of data structures and efficient sets and
						maps using hash-consed keys.

  html			html.lib		This library provides parsing and pretty
						printing of HTML (Version 3.2).

  internet		internet.lib		Networking utilities (for both Unix
						and Windows).

  prettyprint		prettyprinter.lib	Pretty-printing library.

  reactive		reactive.lib	A low-level reactive scripting library.

  regex			(lib7.lib)		Newer regular-expression library.
  regular-expressions	regexp-lib.lib	Older regular-expression library.

  posix			posix.lib		Posix-based utilities.

The first column is the source directory, the second gives the library sources
file alias (to be used in your application's Makefile.lib file), and the third
column gives a brief description.  Look at the Doc dicrectory and at the README
files in the individual subdirectories for more documentation.

Three of these libraries are critical for bootstrapping on a new system:

   utilities
   pp
   html

(The latter is not actually used by the Lib7 compiler,
but pp statically depends upon it.)
