# Same as src/lib/src/key.api

# Compiled by:
#     src/lib/std/standard.lib

# Used in:
#     src/lib/src/setx.api



# Our red-black trees etc can use as keys
# any set of distinct values upon which
# a total order is defined:


api Keyxy {
    #
    Key(X,Y);
    compare:  (Key(X,Y), Key(X,Y)) -> Order;
};
