									# list_to_string' is given an initial string (first), a separator (between), a terminating
									# string (last), and an item formatting function (to_string), and returns a list
									# formatting function.  The list ``[a, b, ..., c]'' gets formatted as
									# ``first + (to_string a) + between + (to_string b) + between + ... + between + (to_string c) + last.''
