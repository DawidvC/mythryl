## compiler-configuration.api

# Compiled by:
#     src/lib/compiler/core.sublib



# We configure the compiler two ways:
# (1) Interactive use, compiling to memory;
# (2) Batch use, compiling to disk.
#
# We use Compiler_Configuration values
# to specify the difference -- see
# mythryl-compiler-g.pkg.



###                   Modern man has the skill:
###                    he can do what he will.
###                   But, alas, being man,
###                    he will do what he can.

###        "In all spheres of human intellectual and practical
###         activity, from carpentry to golf, from sculpture to
###         space travel, the true craftsman is the one who
###         thoroughly understands his tools.  And this applies
###         to programmers too.  A programmer who fully understands
###         his language can tackle more complex tasks, and complete
###         them quicker and more satisfactorily than if he did not."
