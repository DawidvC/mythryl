# emit-treecode-heapcleaner-calls.api
#
# This is an alternative module for generating
# heapcleaner ("garbage collector") invocation code.
# There are a few improvements.
#
# All code to invoke heapcleaner is generated once at the end of the
# compilation unit---with one exception. For each cluster, a 
# call to heapcleaner is a jump  to the end of the cluster  where there 
# is another jump.
#
# Code to invoke heapcleaner for known functions is generated at the end of
# the cluster. This is important as there may be spilling across
# heapcleaner invocation calls.

# Compiled by:
#     src/lib/compiler/core.sublib
