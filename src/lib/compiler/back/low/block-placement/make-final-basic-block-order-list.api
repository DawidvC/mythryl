## make-final-basic-block-order-list.api
#
# The fastest jump is the jump eliminated by having one basic block fall
# through to the next.  Consequently, one important code improvment technique
# ("optimization") is to order the basic blocks in a controlflow graph so that
# the most-frequently-used jumps vanish in this way.
#
# Earlier phases provide hints toward this goal by setting to FALLSTHRU
# or (BRANCH FALSE) those edges in the controlflow graph which they estimate
# to be most worth eliminating in this way.
#
# Here we define the API to the modules which complete this task by actually
# selecting a final global ordering for all basic blocks in a controlflow graph.
#
# This code appears to use pretty naive algorithms.
# For a more sophisticated analysis of the block ordering
# problem and dynamic programming algorithm see:

#  Perform code block placement 

# When several blocks are successors to the unique entry node, 
# then block with the lowest block id appears first.
# This usually corresponds to what one wants when doing dynamic 
# code generation.

#             so much that he is better at solving difficult
#             problems -- although he usually is -- as that he
#             is better at avoiding them in the first place."
