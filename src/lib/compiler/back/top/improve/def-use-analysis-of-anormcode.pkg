# Internal vs External references:
# I started with a version that kept track separately of internal and external
# uses.  This has the advantage that if the extuses count goes to zero, we can
# consider the function as dead.  Without this, recursive functions can never
# be recognized as dead during fcontract (they are still eliminated at the
# beginning, tho).  This looks nice at first, but poses problems:
# - when you do simple inlining (just moving the body of the procedure), you
#   may inadvertently turn ext-uses into int-uses.  This only happens when
#   inlining mutually recursive function, but this can be commen (think of
#   when fcontract undoes a useless uncurrying of a recursive function).  This
#   can be readily overcome by not using the `move body' optimization in
#   dangerous cases and do the full copy+kill instead.
# - you have to keep track of what is inside what.  The way I did it was to
#   have an 'inside' REF cell in each fun.  That was a bad idea.  The problem
#   stems from the fact that when you detect that a function becomes dead,
#   you have to somehow reset those `inside' REF cells to reflect the location
#   of the function before you can uncount its references.  In most cases, this
#   is unnecessary, but it is necessary when undertaking a function mutually
#   recursive with a function in which you currently are when you detect the
#   function's death.
# rather than fix this last point, I decided to give up on keeping internal
# counts up-to-date.  Instead, I just compute them once during collect and
# never touch them again:  this means that they should not be relied on in
# general.  More specifically, they become potentially invalid as soon as
# the body of the function is changed.  This still allows their use in
# many cases.
