# Here we accept a Raw_Expression argument together
# with a user-supplied Raw_Expression -> Raw_Expression
# transform, and apply the transform in post-order to
# all type-appropriate sub/expressions of the argument.
#
# The argument is not modified; all necessary parts of
# it are copied.
#
# We also allow the transform functions to add to a
# list of results, if desired.
#
# There's nothing subtle here;  just a matter of grinding
# through all the relevant phrase-structure rules.
#
# (You'd think there would be a way of automating this kind of coding.)
#
# At present this is only used to implement implicit thunk
# parameters by converting IMPLICIT_THUNK_PARAMETER nodes
# to VARIABLE_IN_EXPRESSION nodes while building up a list
# of all such variables seen:
