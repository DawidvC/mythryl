The standard Mythryl prettyprinter, used pervasively.
It is based on John Reppy's prettyprinter; I have rewritten it thoroughly
at least four times, so the remaining errors are entirely my fault.
Reppy's comments (circa 2007) on his version follow.  -- Cynbe, 2014.

    This is a library for pretty printing.  It provides a much richer
    pretty printing model than the Oppen-style pretty printer provided
    by the compiler.

    Its implementation is based on one by Pierre Weis (Copyright INRIA 1996),
    which was written in CAML.

    This implementation differs in a number of ways from the CAML version:

      1) This pretty printer does not support tabulation boxes yet.

      2) This pretty-printer is genericized over abstract output
	 devices and input tokens.

      3) This pretty-printer supports styled text.

      4) This pretty-printer supports both absolute and relative indentation
	 modes (the former is necessary for block-structured language
	 indentation).

      5) This pretty-printer supports both imperative pretty-printer streams
	 and declarative pretty-printing layouts, which can be intermixed.
