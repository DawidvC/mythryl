## io-startup-and-shutdown--premicrothread.api

# Compiled by:
#     src/lib/std/src/standard-core.sublib


# This module keeps track of open I/O streams,
# and closes themc cleanly at process exit.
#
# NOTE: there is currently a problem with removing
# the at-functions for streams that get dropped
# by the application, but the system limit on
# open files will limit this.				XXX BUGGO FIXME


# This api is implemented in:
#
#     src/lib/std/src/io/io-startup-and-shutdown--premicrothread.pkg
#
