## io-startup-and-shutdown.api

# Compiled by:
#     src/lib/std/standard.lib



# This module keeps track of open I/O streams
# and handles the proper cleaning of them.
#
# It is a modified version of the monothread library package
#
#     src/lib/std/src/io/io-startup-and-shutdown--premicrothread.pkg
#
# Unlike the monothread version, we only do cleanup at
# shutdown/exit time:  We do not try to support the
# persistence of threadkit streams across invocations
# of run_threadkit::run_threadkit).
#
# Also, we only require a single clean-up function, which
# flushes the standard streams and closes all others.
#
# These operations should only be called while threadkit
# is running, since they use synchronization primitives.
#
# NOTE: There is currently a problem with removing the
# cleaners for streams that get dropped by the application,
# but the system limit on open files will limit this.
