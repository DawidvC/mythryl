## print-hook.pkg
#
# This is a hook for the top-level print function, which allows
# it to be rebound.  It is imported from
#
#     src/lib/core/init/print-hook-guts.pkg
#
# via the "print-hook" primitive.  In its original state it is
# a dummy because it is defined at a time when the IO stack
# is not yet available -- that is why we do an assignment here.
#
# (The bootstrap mechanism must make sure that this code actually gets executed.)

# Compiled by:
#     src/lib/std/src/standard-core.sublib
