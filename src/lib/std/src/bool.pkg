###             A sage
###                who had filled his glass
###                    at the fountain of truth
###             Said, in
###                a statement
###                    that later became canonical
###             To his
###                disciples,
###                    patterns of eager youth:
###             "I have
###                seen truth itself --
###                    and it's conical."
###
###                              -- Piet Hein
###
### [ NB: Piet's illustration
###       shows the sage brandishing
###       an overflowing cone-shaped glass. ]
