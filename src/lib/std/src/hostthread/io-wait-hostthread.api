# io-wait-hostthread.api
#
# Interface to a server hostthread designed to basically just
# sit in a loop doing C select() over and over on whatever
# file/pipe/socket descriptors are of current interest.
#
# Our main purpose is to offload I/O blocking from the
# main threadkit hostthread so that it can run full speed				# Threadkit			is from   src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/core-thread-kit/threadkit.api
# while we sit around waiting for network packets to arrive.			# threadkit			is from   src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/core-thread-kit/threadkit.pkg
#
# A secondary purpose of io_wait_hostthread is to provide the
# clock threadkit needs to drive its pre-emptive timeslicing.
# Reppy's original CML implementation uses SIGALRM for this,
# but this has two critical disadvantages:
#
#  o  SIGALRM is a bottleneck resource which everyone wants
#     to control.
#
#  o  Worse, SIGALRM interrupts "slow" system calls, causing
#     them to return EINTR instead of a useful result, requiring
#     the relevant C code to re-try.  We can ensure that our own
#     C support code does this, but one call -- connect() --
#     *cannot* be retried, and we cannot be sure that all C
#     libraries linked into the runtime will retry properly
#     on EINTR. (In fact, I'd bet good odds that some will not.)
#
# By having our select() time out regularly and generate
# a timeslice clock for threadkit based on those timeouts
# we almost completely avoid both of those problems.
#
# ("Almost" because, for example, SIGCHLD can still interrupt
# "slow" syscalls.  But that will usually be very very rare,
# since child process deaths are usually rare and for one
# to hit during a "slow" syscall lacking proper retry-on-EINTR
# will be doubly rare.)

	    # The io_wait_hostthread timeslicer uses us to generate
	    # its (approximately) 50Hz timeslicing "clock". It uses
	    #	
	    #     note_per_loop_fn
	    #	
	    # to register a function with us to be called once
	    # per outer loop (and consequently approximately once
	    # per timeout interval).
	    #
	    # For generality we internally support a list of such
	    # per-loop fns rather than a single such fn, all of which
	    # get called once per outer loop.
	    #
	    # For flexibility we also support removing per-loop fns

	    # for Void->Void values, but they are supported for
	    # refcells -- this is the main reason we wrap per-loop fns
	    # in refcells in these two calls.  (We never assign to
	    # these refcells, although our client -- threadkit scheduler
	    # -- could do so if it wished.)
	    #
	    # Note that if there is a lot of I/O going on, the
	    # loop fn may be called much more frequently than the
	    # timeout interval would suggest.  It is up to the
	    # client to deal with this, if it is a problem.

	    # If we are listening on any fd, then we can eventually
