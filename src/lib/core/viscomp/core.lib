# This used to be called all-files.lib, then Makefile.lib, and even later
# viscomp-lib.lib (at which point it became "just a library").
# It is now reduced to the machine-independent core part of the
# library.  Machine-dependent parts are in viscomp/<arch>.lib.

# Moved to core/viscomp for better path-anchor organization.
