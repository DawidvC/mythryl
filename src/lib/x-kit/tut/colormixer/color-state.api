## color-state.pkg
#
# A very simple package implementing Color_State imps
# which remember their RGB color, accept requests to
# change one or all of the RGB color components, and
# report each change to an output mailslot.

# Compiled by:
#     src/lib/x-kit/tut/colormixer/colormixer-app.lib

# This api is implemented in:
