## ro-pixmap-old.api
#
#   The three kinds of X server rectangular arrays of pixels
#   supported by x-kit are window, rw_pixmap and ro_pixmap.
#
#      o 'window': are on-screen  and on the X-server.
#      o 'rw_pixmap': are off-screen and on the X-server.
#      o 'ro_pixmap': offscreeen, immutable and on the X-server.
#
#   These all have 'depth' (bits per pixel) and
#   'size' (in pixel rows and cols) information.
#   Windows have in addition 'upperleft' position
#   (relative to parent window) and border width in pixels.
#
#   (A fourth kind of rectangular array of pixels is the
#   clientside 'cs_pixmap_old'.  These are not 'drawable', but
#   pixels can be bitblt-ed between them and server-side
#   windows and pixmaps.)
