## cs-pixmap-old.api			"cs" == "client-side"
#
#   A client-side rectangular array of pixels.
#   X jargon calls it an "Ximage" but I prefer
#   a name more obviously related to pixmaps.
#
#   Support for copying back and forth between
#   client-side and server-side pixmaps makes
#   them useful for specifying icons, tiling
#   patterns and other client-originated image
#   data intended for X display.
