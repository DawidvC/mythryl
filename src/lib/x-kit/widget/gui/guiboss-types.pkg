#
# The application programmers passes guiboss_imp a Guiplan
# to define the GUI, which is then converted to a running
# Guipane which is then abstracted on request into a Guipith
# via Gadget_To_Guiboss.get_guipiths for application massaging and
# via Gadget_To_Guiboss.install_updated_guipiths conversion back
# into running-GUI form:  This is the main application tool for
# restructing a running GUI.
#
# In addition to defining the three GUI representations, this
# file defines most (but not all) of the major ports between
# guiboss_imp and other imps:								# "gadget" refers to any of "widget", "sprite" or "object".  (Most frequently, "widget".)
#
#	Guiboss_To_Gadget								# The general guiboss_imp -> gadget interface, used for forwarding user mouseclicks etc.  Most frequently used guiboss_imp -> widget_imp, but also to sprite_imp and object_imp.
#	Gadget_To_Guiboss								# The general gadget -> guiboss_imp interface, used for forwarding draw operations  etc.
#       #
#	Guiboss_To_Widgetspace								# The guiboss_imp -> widgetspace_imp, used to manage layout of widgets on windows.  Not yet of much importance in practice.
#	Guiboss_To_Objectspace								# The guiboss_imp -> objectspace_imp, used to manage layout of objects on windows.  Not yet of much importance in practice.

															#  o  Popup hierarchy may not be modified.  Use make_popup()/kill_popup() for that.  This restriction is pure implementation laziness: we'll presumbly lift it eventually.
															#  o  Tabports and Scrollports may not be modified beyond substituting widgets.      This restriction is pure implementation laziness: we'll presumbly lift it eventually.
															# As a convenience, XI_ROW, XI_COL and XI_GRID instances may be freely created and inserted. (In general guipith values may be only re-arranged or dropped, outside of XI_GUIPLAN.)
# XXX QUERO FIXME I think maybe we should have call(s) here to subscribe to events like garbage collection, disk-full, low-on-ram etc.
# Having method(s) here to register a fn to be called for a given event is a simple, effective way to implement that functionality.
# One could argue that such events have little to do with GUIs and hence should not be the purvue of guiboss-imp, but guiboss-imp
# is the established architecture apps will be using to process the dominant event streams (mouseclicks + keypresses), so piggybacking
# on that takes advantage of established app architecture as well as established internal guiboss_imp architecture.  We need at least
# DISK_FULL and RAM_FULL in order to write robust apps that deal gracefully with resource exhaustion.  CPU_FULL would be a logical
# correlate, so apps can cut back on background processing when CPU cycles are in short supply. It might be worth just running through
# the list of standard Unix signals and thinking about which of them might also be best coupled to the Mythryl GUI-app world by turning
# them into events delivered through this mechanism.  SIGPWR and SIGHUP might make sense...?

#   Gadget_To_Guiboss should maybe export the log.pkg fns, as futureproofing
#   against distributed-computation situations where the GUI runs remote from
#   the application and we want logging to be centralized in the application.

# layout problems simple.
#
# In general, complex widget layout issues should be handled by
