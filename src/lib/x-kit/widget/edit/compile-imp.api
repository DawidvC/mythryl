## compile-imp.api
#
# The SML/NJ compiler was written for a single-threaded
# execution model and uses many global variables, so it
# is important that we run only one compile at a time.		# Until this is fixed!
# 
# That is our main job here;  by doing compiles via us,
# eval-mode.pkg etc avoid any risk of multiple compiles
# colliding.
#
# The actual work ultimately gets done by
#     parse_string_to_raw_declarations
#     compile_raw_declaration_to_package_closure
#     link_and_run_package_closure
# in
#     src/lib/compiler/toplevel/interact/read-eval-print-loop-g.pkg
