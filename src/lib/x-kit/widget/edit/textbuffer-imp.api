## textbuffer-imp.api
#
# These imps manage textbuffers each holding (typically)
# the contents of a file while it is being edited.
#
# These need to be separate from the editpane imps because
# in the emacs model multiple editpanes may be open onto a
# single shared textbuffer, so we need the textbuffers to
# be imps to enforce proper mutual exclusion between editpanes
# during editpane requests to the shared textbuffer.
