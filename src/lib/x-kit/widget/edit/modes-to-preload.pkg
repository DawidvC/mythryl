## modes-to-preload.pkg
#
# A key design goal was to make panes and modes very
# independent of the core logic, in particular to have
# app-specific non-standard panes and modes have the
# same privileges as the stock built-in ones.
#
# Unfortunately, this modularity has proceeded so far
# that the Mythryl build system does not even recognize
# the stock panes as being needed.  :-)
#
# Hence this file, which explicitly forces them to load.
# There is a dependency on this file in
#
#     src/lib/x-kit/widget/edit/millboss-imp.pkg
#
# and here we establish dependencies on the other stock
# modes which we want preloaded.
#
# NB: The modes all have explicit internal dependencies
# on their corresponding mills, so we do not need to
# explicitly force mills to load here.

# Compiled by:
#     src/lib/x-kit/widget/xkit-widget.sublib
