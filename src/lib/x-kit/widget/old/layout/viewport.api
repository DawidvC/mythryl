## viewport.api
#
#     "A viewport provides a classical window on the virtual
#      graphical space of an underlying widget.  In effect,
#      the underlying widget can be arbitrarily large, but
#      only the part of it that is projected through the
#      viewport's window is visible.  The amount of the underlying
#      window that can be seen depends on the size of the viewport
#      window.  In addition, the viewport's position relative to the
#      underlying widget can be changed, providing panning.
#      A viewport is usually tied to other widgets such as
#      scrollbars to give the user control over the panning."

#
# A Viewport has the same ideal size as its child,
# but may be arbitrarily shrunk or grown.  If the
# child widget is large it is usually a good idea
# to wrap the viewport in another widget which
# limits its size, such as a Size_Preference_Wrapper:
#     src/lib/x-kit/widget/old/wrapper/size-preference-wrapper.api
#
# At realization time the child's window is made a subwindow
# of the viewport's window.  The child's subwindow is always
# precisely the size requested by the child.
#
# Any change in the viewport's size or position relative
# to the child widget are reported via the mailop returned by
#
#     get_viewport_configuration_change_mailop
#
# This makes it easy for other widgets such as associated
# scrollbars to monitor viewport # changes and update
# themselves appropriately.
#
#
# Two ways of providing a Viewport with scrollbars:
#     widget_with_scrollbars:
#         src/lib/x-kit/widget/old/layout/widget-with-scrollbars.api
#     scrolled_widget:
#         src/lib/x-kit/widget/old/layout/scrolled-widget.api
