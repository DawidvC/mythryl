## divider.api
#
# Draw a horizontal or vertical division between
# other widgets, to visually clarify the user
# interface layout.
#
# The divider is drawn as a line in the
# color specified, which defaults to black.
#
# A horizontal divider is drawn as a line
# 'width' pixels thick vertically and is
# completely elastic horizontally; similarly
# with a vertical divider.
#
# A negative 'width' raises BAD_ARG.
