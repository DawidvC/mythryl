## Convert RAW_SYNTAX_TREEs to makelib's trimmed version thereof ("module_dependencies_summarys").

# Compiled by:
#     src/app/makelib/makelib.sublib

#   The ideas here are based on those found in the original SC and
#   also in an older version of makelib (before 1999).  However, nearly
#   all aspects have been changed radically, and the code has been
#   re-written from scratch.
#
#   The module_dependencies_summarys generated by this module are typically smaller
#   than the "decl"s in SC or old versions of makelib.  This should
#   make dependency analysis somewhat faster (but is probably not
#   very noticeable).

# This api is implemented in:
#     src/app/makelib/compilable/raw-syntax-to-module-dependencies-summary.pkg

stipulate
    package raw =  raw_syntax;							# raw_syntax			is from   src/lib/compiler/front/parser/raw-syntax/raw-syntax.pkg
    package err =  error_message;						# error_message			is from   src/lib/compiler/front/basics/errormsg/error-message.pkg
    package mds =  module_dependencies_summary;					# module_dependencies_summary	is from   src/app/makelib/compilable/module-dependencies-summary.pkg
herein

    api Raw_Syntax_To_Module_Dependencies_Summary {
	#
	convert:  { tree:  raw::Declaration,
		    #
		    err:   err::Severity
			-> raw::Source_Code_Region
			-> String
			-> Void
		  }
		  ->
		  { module_dependencies_summary:  mds::Declaration,
		    complain:                     Void -> Void
		  };
    };
end;
