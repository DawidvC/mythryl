    # FREEZE_NONE is self-explanatory -- the library's sourcefiles are
    #             compiled to .compiled files but no freezefile containing
    #             them is built.
    #
    # FREEZE_ALL  is almost equally self-explanatory:  After compiling
    #             files  all sourcefiles to .compiled files, they are combined
    #             into a 'frozen' archive file -- and the same is done
    #             recursively to all referenced libraries.  (We require
    #             that a frozen library depend only on other frozen
    #             libraries.
    #
    # FREEZE_ONE  means to freeze the indicated library, but not libraries
    #             referenced by it.  (Given the above-mentioned restriction,
    #             this means that all referenced libraries must -already-
    #             be frozen, else the operation will fail.)
