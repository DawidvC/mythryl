## write-symbol-index-file.api -- dump listing mapping toplevel symbols to the files that define them.

# Compiled by:
#     src/app/makelib/makelib.sublib

# For a given library (foo.lib), generate a
# foo.lib.index file for human consumption which
# lists for each top-level symbol (which in practice
# means for each package or generic) the file
# which defines it.
